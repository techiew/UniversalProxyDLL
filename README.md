# Universal Proxy DLL
A header-only library for proxying DLLs with one function call:

```cpp
UPD::CreateProxy(dll);
```

### Features:
* No .masm or other assembly files required
* No module definition files (.def) files required
* No project configuration required
* Built DLL can dynamically proxy any [supported DLL](#supported-dlls) without rebuilding (just rename the DLL)
* Easily create [callbacks](#add-a-callback) for exported functions
* No race conditions (exported functions will wait for proxy creation)
* No [LoadLibrary calls](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-best-practices) within DllMain
* Works for 32-bit and 64-bit games (32-bit has limited support!)

## Usage
A simple DLL with a DllMain like this is all that is needed:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

#include "UniversalProxyDLL.h"

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)
{
    if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
    {
        UPD::OpenDebugTerminal();
        UPD::CreateProxy(hinstDLL);
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

That's it! The DLL will then be proxied properly.

In the following example, Elden Ring was proxied with a dxgi.dll proxy:

**Note: The debug terminal is optional.**

From there you can create a new thread and do the usual proxy DLL stuff:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

#include "UniversalProxyDLL.h"

DWORD WINAPI NewThread(LPVOID lpParam)
{
    printf("Doing some very naughty stuff\n");
    char* p = nullptr;
    char c = *p;
    return 0;
}

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)
{
    if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
    {
        UPD::OpenDebugTerminal();
        UPD::CreateProxy(hinstDLL);
        CreateThread(0, 0, &NewThread, NULL, 0, NULL);
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

## Adding a callback
You may add callbacks back to your own code for when an exported function is called:

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

#include "UniversalProxyDLL.h"

using FpDirectInput8Create = HRESULT (*)(HINSTANCE, DWORD, REFIID, LPVOID*, LPUNKNOWN);
void* fpDirectInput8Create = nullptr;

HRESULT CallbackDirectInput8Create(HINSTANCE hinst, DWORD dwVersion, REFIID riidltf, LPVOID* ppvOut, LPUNKNOWN punkOuter)
{
    printf("Callback called!\n");
    return (*(FpDirectInput8Create*)fpDirectInput8Create)(hinst, dwVersion, riidltf, ppvOut, punkOuter);
}

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)
{
    if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
    {
        UPD::OpenDebugTerminal();
        fpDirectInput8Create = UPD::RegisterCallback("DirectInput8Create", &CallbackDirectInput8Create);
        UPD::CreateProxy(hinstDLL);
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

Dinput8.dll was proxied in this example. 

Your callback will be called directly prior to the exported function being executed.

**Note: It's crucial that the function signature for the callback exactly matches the function signature of the exported function. For instance, the function signature for "DirectInput8Create" used in the example was found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ee416756(v=vs.85)).**

**As for the** `return` **with a call to the original exported function - in some cases you might get away with omitting it, but I wouldn't recommend it.**

## Supported DLLs
Yes, in practice this project is not truly *universal*, only in theory. See section "Adding support for a DLL". 

**The most common proxy DLLs are supported out of the box:**
* dxgi
* d3d10
* d3d11
* ~~d3d12~~ (see issue [#1](https://github.com/techiew/UniversalProxyDLL/issues/1))
* dinput8
* XInput1_3
* XInput1_4
* steam_api64
* steam_api
* opengl32
* winhttp
* bink2w64

**Note: I do not guarantee that all supported DLLs will work for 32-bit games. Trial and error is required in this case.**

## Adding support for a DLL
Adding support for a DLL is simple. In the "scripts" folder you will find some Python scripts. 

Use the `create_export_list.py` script by running `python create_export_list.py <path_to_dll>`. This will create a "&lt;dll&gt;_export_list.txt" file in the script folder:

![create_export_list pic](https://github.com/techiew/UniversalProxyDLL/blob/master/pictures/create_export_list.png)

Copy the contents of the generated file to somewhere at the bottom of "UniversalProxyDLL.h" and build:

![New exports pic](https://github.com/techiew/UniversalProxyDLL/blob/master/pictures/new_exports.png)

The DLL should now be proxied correctly. 

**Note: If your DLL has a higher number of exports than the current amount of Forward and ForwardOrdinal functions, you must also use the scripts `create_export_ordinals.py` and `create_forward_functions.py` to generate an amount of functions equal to or higher than the number of exports of your DLL.**

**Also note: Some system DLLs such as user32 may refuse to be proxied!**

## Checking which DLLs a game loads
To check which DLLs you can use to create proxies for specific games, you may for example use the `dumpbin` tool provided with Visual Studio:

## Used in...
Some of my other projects, such as [DirectXHook](https://github.com/techiew/DirectXHook) and [Elden Mod Loader](https://github.com/techiew/EldenRingModLoader).

## Contributions
If you find that a DLL is not supported and you've added the exports yourself, I'd appreciate if you'd create a PR so the exports can be made available to others. Thank you.
